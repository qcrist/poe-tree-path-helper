Contains all the code necessary to generate the tree viewer html file.

Source code is a bit of a mess, this project is just for fun, so haven't made a huge effort to keep it clean.

I have been working on this off and on for quite a few years, but never got around to finishing it due to multiple excellent existing tools (path of building, poeplanner, pathofpathing). But with the launch of Path of Exile 2, many of the existing tools haven't been updated yet, so I finally got the motivation to finish it.
